How to run:
The program is written in python3. Ensure that current directory includes rpm295_project_4.py, inputs.csv, outputs.csv, and transactions.csv and enter
the command "python rpm295_project_4.py" via the terminal. It takes ~50 min to run to
completion on my machine.

  The joint control heuristic can register a false positive when two separate entities
  combine inputs in a single transaction. For example two roommates could provide
  common inputs into a single transaction to pay their landlord.
  The serial control heuristic can register a false positive when someone has exactly
  enough money in their account for the payment they want to make.
  One source of false negatives is when an entity sends money to themselves but 
  generates a change address in the process. This won't be seen as serial control
  since a change address is used. 
  You can increase clustering accuracy by monitoring the behavior of addresses
  over time. If one address behaves significantly different from others associated with 
  it you could reason they in fact belong to separate entities.
